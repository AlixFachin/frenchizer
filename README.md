<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6MbsT5NgoQAUldPq/giphy.gif" width="400px">

This neat utility will enable to change your English sentence into French so that every person in Paris will understand what you mean. 
*Please note*: This utility will however *not* make them listen to you, respect you or care about what you are trying to say.

For example,
```
// This is the castle of our master, Guy de Loimbard!
```
becomes

```
Uh zis is ze castle of ouR masteR, Guy de LoimbaRd sacrebleu!
```

or 
```
// I don't think he will be very keen you see, because he already got one
```
becomes
``` 
// Uh I don't zink he will be veRy keen you see, because he alReady got one sacrebleu
```

This author will not be liable for any taunt due to the French characters.
